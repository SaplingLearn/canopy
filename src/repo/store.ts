 *     `[trendSinceIso, freshSinceIso)` of the metrics a trend is drawn from
 *     (`sap_c_<key>_24h` and `sap_t_<key>`) — the daily totals.
 *
 * Shaped as a LOOSE INDEX SCAN, because the obvious form (`metric GLOB 'sap_*'
 * AND (at >= ? OR …)`) does use `idx_repo_metrics_series` but only for the
 * `metric` range: it walks EVERY stored `sap_` entry — ~33k at steady state for
 * two environments (81 metrics each: 7 days of hourly rows plus ~93 older
 * midnights) — to return ~3k. Here the recursive `names` CTE hops from one
 * distinct metric name to the next (one index seek each), and each (name, env)
 * then seeks its own `at` range — and, for the trend, each midnight by
 * equality — so the rows READ track the rows returned, not the rows stored.
 * Measured at that volume (sqlite 3.53, this schema): ~2.7 ms against ~5.6 ms
 * for the plain form, a gap that widens with retention. What the shape saves is
 * reads, NOT the sort: `UNION ALL … ORDER BY` costs a temp b-tree in both arms
 * either way.
 *
 * Bound parameters: one per environment, one per midnight (≤ 31 for a 30-day
 * trend) and one bound — far under D1's 100. No environment → no read. Both
 * bounds are normalised as `metricsSince` normalises its own; an unparseable
