 *   usage    `runUsagePolls`, unchanged — Cloudflare, Railway, the app's metrics.
 *   github   `reconcileRepo` with the service token: deploys, checks, runs,
 *            branches, drift, open PRs, env heads, the `canopy/*` commit
 *            statuses and PR reviews. `"not_configured"` without

 *            out of it — they land in `failed` by NAME).
 *
 * THE CRON DOES NOT CALL THIS. `handleRepoCron` below spreads one heavy job per
 * tick because the jobs together did not fit an invocation; this function fits
 * only because it leaves the unbounded one out. The on-demand budget, counted
 * from the code: health 2N + usage 3N + reconcile (19 + 2N) = **19 + 7N**
 * subrequests — 33 for today's two environments, and the free plan's 50 caps
 * it at **N ≤ 4** (47; N = 5 is 54). Past that the GITHUB arm is SKIPPED and
 * says so (`BUDGET_SKIP`) rather than risk the whole invocation dying half-way
 * — health and usage (5N) still run. The formula is the worst case on purpose:
 * it does not discount an unconfigured poller.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here:
 *   `recomputeAllProgress`  UNBOUNDED — one request per issue number of every
 *                           array-ref sprint; it is the reason the cron gives it
 *                           a tick of its own, and it feeds the Roadmap, not
 *                           this dashboard.
 *   `pruneRepoCapture`      maintenance, not a refresh — nothing on screen
 *                           changes because old rows were deleted.
 *   `runBackfill`/summaries that is "Sync GitHub": My Work's capture, with its
 *                           own Gemini budget loop. It is ALSO the only
 *                           non-webhook writer of the `events` issue snapshots,

 *                           issue lines do NOT move on a poll — they refresh
 *                           with Sync GitHub. The button's title says so.
 *
 * The result carries outcomes and NEVER a token, a header or an account id:
 * health details are fixed words, usage details are the pollers' scrubbed
 * messages, and `github.failed` is arm names or one of two fixed phrases.
 * (`reconcile` is a test seam: every arm of the real one is guarded, so the

 *                function the admin's "Poll usage now" runs), and nothing else
 *                may run on this tick. Three pollers, each its own guarded
 *                arm (one failing
 *                never skips another): `pollCloudflare` — 1 GraphQL request
 *                per environment (2 today), skipped entirely unless BOTH

 *                `pollRailway` — 1 GraphQL request per environment that HAS a
 *                project token (`RAILWAY_TOKEN_<KEY>`, ≤2 today), skipped
 *                entirely when none does; and `pollSaplingMetrics` — 1 GET per

 *                hop), skipped entirely unless `SAPLING_METRICS_TOKEN` is set.

 *                turn, every fetch under its own timeout — 8s health
 *                (concurrent) + 2×10s Cloudflare + 2×10s Railway + 2×8s

 *                issues one request per issue number of every array-ref
 *                sprint, so it gets an invocation to itself.
 *   :20 (h%6)    `reconcileRepo` — worst case 19 + 2N requests for N
 *                environments (23 today): 2 PR lists + 1 pre-capture commit
 *                window + 1 GraphQL deployments + 1 workflow-run list + ≤5 job
 *                lookups + 1 commit-status list + 1 GraphQL reviews + 5 GraphQL
 *                branch pages + 2 drift compares + 2 per environment (head
 *                commit, head checks). With the tick's own pings that is
 *                19 + 4N — 27 today, and N ≤ 7 under the 50.
