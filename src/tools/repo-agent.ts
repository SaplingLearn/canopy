// The Repo dashboard, shaped for an AGENT — the read behind MCP `get_repo_dashboard`.
//
// This is a VIEW over the projection, never a second projection: every number
// comes from `getRepoDashboard` (src/tools/repo.ts — D1 only, nothing on that
// path fetches), exactly what `GET /repo/dashboard` hands the screen. All this
// file does is make it fit an agent's context:
//   · `tab`   — only the sections that tab shows (`REPO_TAB_SECTIONS`, the ONE
//               section→tab mapping, shared with web/src/repo.ts);
//   · `range` — the usage / cloudflare / product sections carry three ranges
//               for the screen's selector; an agent gets ONE;
//   · trends  — sparkline arrays are stripped, and the drift breakdown is cut
//               to a bounded list of group headers, unless asked for.
// A section's STATUS is never touched: `not_connected` and `empty` pass through
// as they are — unknown is never coerced into a zero or an empty list.
//
// READ-ONLY. The on-demand refresh (`POST /admin/poll`, and the narrower older
// `POST /admin/poll-usage`) and Sync GitHub stay
// session-cookie + admin routes and are never MCP tools.
