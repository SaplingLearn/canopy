// Ticket writers — DIRECT AUTHORED WRITES, in the promote class.
//
// Nothing here goes through `consume()` / the ingestion gate: a ticket is filed
// by a signed-in human through a cookie route, so there is no vocabulary to
// police, no confidence to weigh, no staged state to confirm. `done` / `declined`
// are set here only because a person asked for them — never inferred from a PR
// merging or an issue closing (the brief's fourth invariant). The one carve-out
// lives OUTSIDE this file: a ticket mirrored from a GitHub issue follows that
// issue's close/reopen through ./ticket-mirror.ts's private writer.
//
// Two rules hold across every function in this file:
//   1. Every write bumps `tickets.updated_at` — the queue is sorted by it, so a
//      comment, an assignment or a link has to move the ticket the same way a
//      status change does.
//   2. Every person-bearing value is a person HANDLE (0023 identity root),
//      canonicalized through `persons.handle` so a case variant can never create
//      a second, unrenameable spelling of the same person.
//
// The status machine is NOT re-declared here: `canTransition` in shared/tickets.ts
// is the one table, shared with the SPA.

 * routes never pass a scope — a signed-in human on the web is not assignee-scoped
 * and never was); and `remove_ticket_link` on a LOCKED link — a mirrored ticket's
