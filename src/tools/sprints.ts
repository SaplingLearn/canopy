// Sprint writers + the sprint read model — DIRECT AUTHORED WRITES, promote class.
//
// A sprint is the container the Roadmap shows: it holds tickets (0024) and,
// through `github_ref`, a set of GitHub issues whose closed/total counts are
// cached event-side in `sprint_progress`. Nothing in this file goes through
// `consume()` / the ingestion gate — a sprint is created and reshaped by a
// signed-in human over a cookie route, or by the admin plan write
// (`update_plan` → `write_plan` in plan.ts). `status: 'done'` is set ONLY by
// `complete_sprint` (the Confirm-done button) or the plan write — never inferred
// from tickets resolving or issues closing.
//
// TWO VOCABULARIES. The DB keeps `title` / `target_date`; every DTO here speaks
// `label` / `due` / `active` (shared/sprints.ts documents the seam, and
// `toSprintView` is the one translation). Column names never leave this file.
//
// THE PROGRESS RULE (one place, `sprintProgress` below): a sprint's progress is
// its OWN TICKETS, and nothing else —
//   total  = tickets in the sprint
//   closed = tickets done OR declined
// A sprint with no tickets reads 0/0. The GitHub issues behind a sprint are a
// SEPARATE field (`SprintView.issues`), read from the `sprint_progress` cache
// through `github_ref` and shown only in the Roadmap's Narrative spotlight; they
// are never folded into `progress`. Both halves are read-only D1 — there is NO
// live GitHub call at render, here or anywhere on the read path.
