// The Repo dashboard: a D1-ONLY read projection, in the same class as My Work —
// no live GitHub, no per-user token, nothing written. It reads what the webhook,
// the backfill and the repo cron (src/repo/cron.ts) already captured — deploys,
// checks, runs, branches, drift and environment health, from `repo_events` /
// `repo_snapshots` / `repo_metrics` — plus `events` (merged/closed PRs + issue
// snapshots), the ticket queue and the sprints. Coverage, bundle size and the
// TODO/FIXME count (Task 14) are ALSO `repo_metrics`, fed by the target repo's
// CI posting a commit status (`canopy/coverage` / `canopy/bundle-kb` /
// `canopy/todo`) that the webhook's `status` branch turns into a metric point
// (see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-20-sapling-ci-metrics.md`) — never a
// live scan at render time. The Usage tab's requests / error rate and the
// Cloudflare panel (Task 16) are `repo_metrics` too: hourly `cf_requests` /
// `cf_errors` the repo cron's minute-0 tick polls from Cloudflare's analytics
// API (src/repo/poll.ts), read back here in ONE statement — beside the poll's
// `cf_polled` snapshot, which bounds how far a missing hour may be drawn as 0.
// The hosting block (Task 17) rides that SAME statement: hourly `rw_cpu` /
// `rw_mem_mb` the minute-0 tick polls from Railway, the latest point per
// environment picked out in memory and shown only while it is current.
//
// Active users (Task 18) ride it too: hourly `active_users_<range>` GAUGES the
// minute-0 tick asks Sapling's own backend for — Canopy cannot compute them —
// shown, like hosting, only while the latest reading is current.
//
// Every SECTION now has a capture path, so the `UNCAPTURED` object that used to
// list the ones without is gone with its last entry (hosting). A section — or
// one metric inside the usage section, e.g. `users: null` while Sapling's
// endpoint is not built — whose capture has not landed yet is still
// `not_connected`, never guessed.

 * The Usage tab and the Cloudflare panel, derived IN MEMORY from one read of

 * current hour: only complete hours count, whatever the table holds. `polled`
 * is the `cf_polled` snapshot — per environment, the interval `[from, to)` its
 * polls are known to have looked at (src/repo/poll.ts; read via `cfCovered`).
 *
 * Never guess. Cloudflare returns NO row for an hour without invocations, so a
 * missing bucket is drawn as 0 — leaving it out would silently compress the
 * x-axis — but only where a zero is something we are entitled to say:
 *  - The fill STARTS at the first captured point in the range, or at the
 *    range's start when this read shows capture predates it. Before capture
 *    began the value is unknown, not zero.
 *  - …unless that would cross a HOLE: `polled` holds each environment's covered
 *    INTERVAL `{ from, to }`, and an hour before `from` with no real point is
 *    one no poll ever looked at (an outage longer than the poll's 3-hour
 *    window). The series then starts at `from` — the contiguous covered
 *    stretch only — while the totals still sum every real point in the range.
 *  - The first bucket drawn is the first WHOLE bucket (7d / 30d buckets are
 *    days): a bucket capture or coverage began inside is counted, not drawn.
 *  - The fill ENDS at `min(last complete hour, that environment's covered
 *    `to`)` — and, with NO marker, at the last real point. "No row" means zero
 *    only for an hour a poll looked at; past that the poll may simply be dead.
 *    (A real point is always drawn, whatever the marker says.)
 *  - `requests` is non-null when there is something known in the range: a real
 *    point, OR capture predating the range AND covered hours inside it — the
 *    second reads a true "0" with an all-zero trend. (Its `trend` can still be
 *    `[]` when the only known stretch is one partial bucket; the screen draws
 *    no sparkline under 2 points.)
 *  - `errorRate` needs a real point in the range. With points that sum to 0
 *    requests it is a true "0.00%"; with NO point, 0 of 0 is not a rate: `null`.
 *  - Totals are sums of real points only; the bound changes which zero buckets
 *    the sparkline may draw, never a number.
 *
 * ACTIVE USERS are a different kind of series — an hourly GAUGE Sapling
 * computes at request time ("distinct users in the trailing 24h, as of now"),
 * one metric per range — so none of the above applies to them:
 *  - `users.value` for range R is the LATEST `active_users_R` reading, NEVER a
 *    sum of readings, and only while it is CURRENT: at most `HOSTING_STALE_MS`
 *    older than `now` (and not stamped ahead of it), else `users: null` — an
 *    old gauge is not passed off as now. `null` renders "not connected" under
 *    Active users, which is also the true, designed state while Cloudflare is
 *    connected and Sapling's endpoint is not built yet.
 *  - `users.trend` is the readings inside the trailing range, oldest first,
 *    and is NEVER zero-filled: a missing hour is a poll that did not land —
 *    unknown, not zero users.

  // ── usage + the Cloudflare panel — hourly `cf_*` metrics the repo cron polls
  // at minute 0 (src/repo/poll.ts). ONE statement for every range, environment
  // and series; the 24h / 7d / 30d views are sliced in memory. Same three
  // states as health and coverage: `ok` with something to show, `empty` when a
  // point has EVER landed but nothing is in the window (the poll has gone
  // quiet), `not_connected` when none ever did — and that existence read
  // (`metricsEver`, one more statement) is only made on the not-ok path. No
  // environment configured → nothing to attribute a Worker to: not_connected.
  // The `cf_polled` snapshot (how far each environment's polls have looked —
  // what entitles a missing hour to be drawn as 0) is ONE more read, issued
  // beside the first and never per environment.
  // Active users (Task 18) are in that SAME statement too — `active_users_*`
  // is part of `USAGE_METRICS`, so a CURRENT reading makes `usage` ok on its
  // own, and a reading that has ever landed makes a quiet section `empty`.
  // The hosting block's `rw_*` gauges (Task 17) ride the SAME statement, and its
  // three states mirror health's: `ok` with a CURRENT figure for any
  // environment, `empty` when an `rw_*` row has ever landed but none is current
  // (the Railway poll has stopped), `not_connected` when none ever did.
