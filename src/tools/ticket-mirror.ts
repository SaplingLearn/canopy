// The GitHub issue → ticket MIRROR. Every issue in GITHUB_REPO appears as a
// ticket, linked to the issue by a LOCKED link that can never be removed.
//
// ADR-007, amended (0032): a ticket may link to GitHub work, and may be SOURCED
// from a GitHub issue, but is never the issue itself. A mirrored ticket is a D1
// row Canopy owns, and this module is a COMPUTED write from a verified delivery
// (the webhook, post-HMAC, or the admin backfill) — no `consume()`, no gate.
//
// Who owns what (the owner's ruling, 2026-09-24):
//   - title, body, category, priority, requester, assignees: seeded from the
//     issue when the ticket is CREATED, then Canopy's — a later GitHub edit never
//     overwrites a Canopy edit, and a GitHub (un)assign never touches assignees.
//   - status: Canopy's, under the normal transition table — EXCEPT that GitHub
//     drives closure. A `closed` delivery forces the final state (done /
//     declined), a `deleted` / `transferred` one forces declined, and a
//     `reopened` one reopens a resolved ticket to `submitted`. Those forced moves
//     bypass TICKET_TRANSITIONS (done is terminal for a person, not for GitHub)
//     through `forceStatus` below, which is NOT exported: no route or MCP tool
//     can reach it. Every forced move writes a `ticket_events` row as
//     `github-webhook`.
//   - the source link: locked forever (`ticket_links.locked = 1`); the one delete
//     path, `remove_ticket_link`, refuses it.
//
// Idempotency and ordering: the ticket is keyed on `source_ref` ("owner/repo#n",
// UNIQUE). A delivery whose issue.updated_at is OLDER than the ticket's
// `source_updated_at` is skipped whole. Creation is ONE D1 batch (a transaction)
// whose child inserts are each guarded, so re-running it — a redelivery, a
// backfill overlap, or the heal after a half-failed earlier attempt — writes
// nothing twice.
