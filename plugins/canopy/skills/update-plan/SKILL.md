# Update Plan → Canopy

## Overview

Writes the roadmap plan — narrative and **sprints** — through the **direct, admin-authored**
`update_plan` MCP tool. This is a **promote-class** write, not the ingestion gate: there is no
staging/triage step and no confirmation queue. It IS still non-destructive — every call bumps the
plan version and snapshots the prior state (`plan_versions`), so nothing is lost — but it takes
effect immediately. That's why this skill is **explicit-only**: it must never auto-fire, the same as
`record-session`.

Part of the **`canopy`** skill set. `read-plan` is the read counterpart — always read first (this
skill does so itself, in step 1) so you never write blind.

## When to use / NOT use

- Use only when an admin **explicitly** asks to change the plan: rewrite the narrative, add/edit a
  sprint, or mark one done.
- **Not** for moving tickets in or out of a sprint. Which tickets belong to a sprint is set from the
  Tickets UI (`POST /tickets/:id/sprint`), never from the plan write. This skill owns the sprint's own
  fields only — and since a sprint's progress bar counts its tickets, re-homing a ticket is how that
  bar moves, not an `update_plan` call.
- **Never auto-fire.** Reading the plan, discussing it, or noticing drift is not license to write it —
  that's `read-plan`'s job. Only an explicit ask reaches this skill.
- Never infer `status: 'done'` from issue/PR activity — `done` is only ever admin-said-so, here or via
  the web Confirm-done button. Nothing else agent- or worker-reachable can set it.

## Procedure

### 1. Always `get_roadmap` first (read-before-write)

Call `mcp__canopy__get_roadmap` before composing anything. Carry forward:
- The current `narrative` (you'll pass a full replacement, so start from what's live).
- Every existing sprint's **`id`** — pass `id` on a sprint you're editing so the tool updates it
  in place; a sprint omitted from your call is **untouched**, not deleted. Omitting `id` on a new
  entry creates it.

### 2. Show the admin a diff and get confirmation

Before writing, lay out plainly what will change: narrative before/after (or "narrative unchanged"),
and per sprint — created / edited (with the specific fields changing) / left untouched. Get the
admin's explicit go-ahead on that diff before calling the write tool. If they want changes, revise the
diff and re-confirm — don't call `update_plan` speculatively.

### 3. One `update_plan` call

Once confirmed, make **exactly one** call:

```jsonc
{
  "narrative": "<full narrative text>",
  "sprints": [
    { "id": 3, "label": "Ticket queue", "summary": "One queue the whole org files into.",
      "description": "markdown — **bold**, `code`, links, ### headings, - bullets",
      "phase": "Now", "dates": "Sep 16 – Sep 30", "due": "2026-09-30",
      "status": "in_progress", "urgency": "high", "lead": "AndresL230", "domain": "tickets",
      "github_ref": 42 },
    { "label": "<new sprint, no id>", "due": "2026-10-15", "status": "upcoming" }
  ]
}
```

The sprint vocabulary (the DTO's words, not the column names):

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `label` | the sprint name (required) |
| `due` | target date, `YYYY-MM-DD` (required) |
| `summary` | one line under the label on the Roadmap card |
| `description` | markdown body, rendered on the sprint screen |
| `phase` | coarse plan label — "Now", "Weeks 3-4", "Later" |
| `dates` | human date range, e.g. "Sep 16 – Sep 30" |
| `status` | `upcoming` \| `in_progress` \| `done` (`in_progress` = the Roadmap's **active**) |
| `urgency` | `low` \| `normal` \| `high` (defaults `normal`) |
| `lead` | a person **handle** |
| `domain` | `notifications` \| `tickets` \| `gate` \| `feed` \| `search` \| `infra` |
| `github_ref` | a GitHub milestone number, or an array of issue numbers |

- `id` present → update that sprint; `id` absent → create one.
- On an update, a field you **omit** is left unchanged (`label`, `due` and `status` are required, so
  they always overwrite); passing an explicit `null` is how you **clear** one. Sprint fields also come
  from the Roadmap's New sprint panel, so never re-send a field blank just to fill the shape.
- **You never write progress.** A sprint's `closed/total/pct` is computed at read time as
  **the tickets in the sprint plus the GitHub issues behind `github_ref`** — `total` = tickets +
  cached issues, `closed` = tickets a person marked `done`/`declined` + cached closed issues. A
  sprint with neither reads `0/0`. Editing `github_ref` changes the issue half (the webhook and the
  cron backstop keep its cache current); the ticket half moves only when someone files, resolves or
  re-homes a ticket in the Tickets UI.
- Sprints you don't list are left exactly as they are — you don't need to round-trip every
  sprint, only the ones changing.
- `status: 'done'` is legal here (this is the one agent-reachable path allowed to set it) — only set
  it when the admin explicitly confirmed the sprint is done, never inferred from closed issues or from
  every ticket in the sprint being resolved.
- Report back the new plan `version` the tool returns.

## Hard rules (invariants)

- **Server-gated to `ADMIN_LOGINS`.** `update_plan` is only registered for admin principals — a
  non-admin bearer doesn't have the tool at all (absent from `tools/list`, tool-not-found if called).
  This skill's own instructions are a second layer, not the enforcement boundary.
- **Explicit only.** Never fire without a direct admin ask.
- **Read before write, every time** — step 1 is not optional, even for a small edit.
- **Confirm the diff before writing** — no silent writes.
- **`done` is admin-said-so only** — set here or via the web Confirm-done button, never inferred from
  GitHub activity, issue closure percentage, or `get_events`.
- **One call.** Compose the full sprints array (with unchanged ones simply omitted) and call
  `update_plan` once — this is a direct write, not a reconciling batch, so there's no replay safety net
  if you call it twice with different content.
- This is **not** the ingestion gate — no staging, no triage, no `record_session`. Don't route plan
  writes through those tools.

## Common mistakes

- Forgetting a sprint's `id` when editing it → the tool creates a duplicate instead of updating.
- Using the pre-rename field names (`title` / `target_date`) instead of `label` / `due` → the tool
  rejects the call as a validation error.
- Setting `status: 'done'` because issues look closed, without the admin having said so.
- Skipping the diff/confirmation step and writing straight from the ask.
- Calling `get_roadmap` after deciding what to write instead of before — you lose the current `id`s
  and the real current narrative to diff against.
