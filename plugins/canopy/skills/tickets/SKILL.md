description: Use when a person explicitly asks to work the Canopy ticket queue — file a ticket, start or resolve one, comment on it, link work to it, move it into a sprint, nest it under another, or (for admins) create and manage sprints (triggers — "file a ticket for…", "start that ticket", "mark it done", "comment on ticket 12", "move this to sprint 13", "create a sprint"). Reading the queue needs no skill. Explicit invocation only for writes — must never auto-fire.

# Tickets → Canopy

## Overview

Works the org's ticket queue — the one queue the whole team files into. A ticket is a Canopy D1 row,
**never** a GitHub issue (ADR-007); it may *link* to GitHub or Figma work, it never *is* that work.

These are **direct authored writes in the promote class** — the same class the web UI writes in.
There is no gate, no staging and no triage step: a ticket write **takes effect immediately and is
visible to the whole org**. That is why this skill is **explicit-only**, like `update-plan` and
`record-session`. It must never auto-fire.

Part of the **`canopy`** skill set. Reading the queue does not need this skill at all — the four read
tools are available to every principal and documented in the `canopy` umbrella.

## The lane rule — read this before anything else

> **You may write only to tickets already assigned to you.** Filing a new ticket is the one
> unscoped write.

This is enforced by the Worker, not by this skill. A write outside the lane comes back
`{"error": "…not assigned to you…", "code": "forbidden"}` and **nothing is written**.

Three consequences worth knowing before you promise a person anything:

- **You cannot assign anyone after a ticket is filed.** There is no `toggle_assignee` tool and there
  never will be — assignment is the data the lane rule is built on. `create_ticket`'s `assignees` is
  the only agent-reachable assignment in Canopy.
- **You cannot pick work up off the unassigned pile.** Somebody has to assign it to your principal in
  the web UI first. Say that plainly rather than trying and reporting a failure.
- **You cannot triage other people's tickets** — not comment, not resolve, not re-parent. An admin is
  the one exception, and only for `set_ticket_sprint` (re-homing a ticket into a sprint).

`get_ticket` returns `assignees`. **Check it before proposing a write**, so you never offer to do
something the server will refuse.

## When to use / NOT use

- Use when a person **explicitly** asks for a ticket or sprint change in words like the triggers above.
- **Never auto-fire.** Noticing that a ticket looks stale, that a bug you just fixed has a ticket, or
  that a sprint looks finished is **not** license to write. Reading is free; writing is asked for.
- **Not** for recording what a session did — that's `record-session` (feed / docs / ADRs, through the
  gate). A ticket is somebody's request, not a session log.
- **Not** for the roadmap narrative or a bulk sprint reshape — that's `update-plan`.
- **Never infer a resolution.** `done` / `declined` are set because a person said so in this
  conversation. A merged PR, a closed issue, or every sub-ticket resolving is **not** a person saying
  so. This is Canopy's oldest ticket invariant and this skill is not an exception to it.

## Procedure

### 1. Orient — read before you write

Never write from the conversation's memory of a ticket. Read it back:

- `list_tickets` — `seg` (`open` default / `closed` / `all`), `assignee` (`anyone` / `me` /
  `unassigned`), `category`. Use `assignee: "me"` to find your own lane.
- `get_ticket <id>` — the whole ticket, including **`assignees`** (your lane check) and `status`
  (which moves are even legal).
- `list_sprints` / `get_sprint <id>` before any sprint move, so you name a real sprint.

### 2. Check the lane, and say so if you're outside it

If your principal is not in `assignees`, **stop**. Tell the person which ticket it is, that it is not
assigned to them, and that a person has to assign it in the web UI. Do not call the tool to produce a
refusal you could have predicted.

### 3. Load the team's config, and show a one-line diff

Read `tickets.config.md` (see `references/config.md` — repo root or `.claude/`, all keys optional).
Then show the person exactly what you are about to send, in one line:

```
file ticket · "CSV export drops the header row" · bug / high · sprint: Backlog · assignees: andres
move #42 · submitted → in_progress
```

Wait for confirmation unless the config sets `require_confirmation: false`. **Always** confirm for
`done` and `declined` — those resolve the ticket for the whole org and are terminal; nothing re-opens
a resolved ticket.

`--dry-run`: print the line above and **stop**. No tool call.

### 4. One call, then report what changed

Every write returns the whole ticket. Report the real new state from that response — status,
assignees, sprint — not what you intended to happen. If the call came back with a `code`, say what it
means and what the person should do:

| code | what it means | what to say |
|---|---|---|
| `forbidden` | outside your lane | who needs to assign it, in the web UI |
| `conflict` | a shared rule said no — an illegal status move, or a nesting rule | which rule, and the legal moves from here |
| `bad_request` | your input was wrong — an unknown handle, an unusable link, an empty comment | the specific field |
| `not_found` | no such ticket or sprint | the id you used |

## The status machine

One table, shared with the web UI and the server — this skill never invents a move:

```
submitted    → in_progress | declined
in_progress  → done | declined | submitted
done, declined  — TERMINAL. A resolved ticket is not re-opened.
```

Nesting is exactly **one level**: `set_ticket_parent` fails as a `conflict` if the parent already has
a parent, the child already has a parent, the child is resolved, or the child has sub-tickets of its
own. You need the lane on **both** tickets.

## Sprints (admin only)

`create_sprint`, `set_sprint_active`, `complete_sprint` and `add_sprint_resource` exist **only** for an
admin principal — if you are not an admin, they are not in your tool list at all, and that is the
answer to give. Which *tickets* are in a sprint is `set_ticket_sprint`, not a sprint tool.

`complete_sprint` reports to the whole org that a body of work finished. **Always confirm with the
admin first**, and never infer it from the sprint's tickets all being resolved — the Roadmap computes
progress from tickets, but `done` is a person's statement.

## Hard rules

- **Never auto-fire.** Explicit ask only.
- **Never infer `done` / `declined`**, on a ticket or a sprint.
- **Never claim you assigned someone** after filing — you cannot.
- **Read the ticket back before writing it**, every time.
- **Your writes are attributed to your principal with nothing marking them agent-made.** If the team
  wants agent comments recognizable, `comment_prefix` in the config is how (see `references/config.md`).
