// The *_fts virtual tables are populated by AFTER INSERT triggers and cleared by
// AFTER DELETE triggers on their base tables. The test harness truncates the base
// data tables (docs/feed/adrs) `beforeEach` — so for the FTS index to stay clean
// across tests, those delete-triggers must cascade `DELETE FROM <base>` into the
// matching `*_fts` table. These tests prove (a) the index starts empty every test
// (no leak from a prior test) and (b) the harness's exact truncation statement
// leaves zero leaked FTS rows.
